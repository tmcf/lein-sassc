# lein-sassc

Leiningen plugin to compile SASS/SCSS files with [SassC](https://github.com/sass/sassc).

*This version allows specifying sassc executable by using the ``:executable`` config key.* which I have
seen in one existing version of this plugin, but not the one this was forked from.

This was done as a work-around to a problem that only appeared when launching a repl using Cursive within IntelliJ.

This version is not published to clojars so you must build and install it to maven local to use.

## Installation

```clj
(defproject example "1.0.0"
  :plugins [[errigal751/lein-sassc "0.10.5-SNAPSHOT"]])
```

Make sure you have a [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc) command.

## Configuration

The configuration for sassc is specified under the `:sassc` sections of your `project.clj`.

The *:executable* key is new to this version. Each sassc {} config block would need its own :executable to
override the default value of ``sassc``.


```
(defproject example "1.0.0"
  :sassc [{:executable   "/some/path/sassc"    ;; default "sassc"
           :src          "src/scss/page1.scss" ;; default "src/scss/main.scss"
           :output-to    "dist/page1.css"      ;; default "target/sassc/main.css"
           :style        "compressed"          ;; "nested" or "compressed", default "nested"
           :import-path  "src/scss"}           ;; default "src/scss"
          {:src       "src/scss/page2.scss"
           :output-to "dist/page2.css"}}])
```

The above configuration run the following commands.

```sh
$ sassc -t compressed -I src/scss src/scss/page1.scss dist/page1.css
$ sassc -t nested -I src/scss src/scss/page2.scss dist/page2.css
```

Multiple source paths may be specified by setting :import-path to a vector:

```
(defproject example "1.0.0"
  :sassc [{:src          "src/scss/page1.scss"       ;; default "src/scss/main.scss"
           :output-to    "dist/page1.css"            ;; default "target/sassc/main.css"
           :style        "compressed"                ;; "nested" or "compressed", default "nested"
           :import-path  ["src/scss" "other/scss"]}  ;; default "src/scss"
          {:src       "src/scss/page2.scss"
           :output-to "dist/page2.css"}}])
```

The above configuration results in the following commands:

```sh
$ sassc -t compressed -I src/scss -I other/scss src/scss/page1.scss dist/page1.css
$ sassc -t nested -I src/scss -I other/scss src/scss/page2.scss dist/page2.css
```

## Usage

Compile your files once:

```sh
$ lein sassc once
```

To delete all the files generated by lein-sassc

```
$ lein sassc clean
```

## Hooks

The following hooks are supported by lein-sassc:

```
$ lein compile
$ lein clean
```

To enable the hooks, add the following lein to your `project.clj` file:

```clj
:hooks [leiningen.sassc]
```
